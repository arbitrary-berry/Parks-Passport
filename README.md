## Introduction

Park Passport is a demo application to keep track of all the National Parks you've visited and your reviews.

### As a user I can:

* Keep track of the National Parks you've visited

* You can search the different Parks, and click on each photo to show more details about that park

* On the left-hand side you can leave a review of a park.

## Roadmap

Ideas for future releases:

- A login so each user can have their own passport profile.
- National Park Service colors to the theme.
- A click feature on the heart in each Park and have that added to the WishList on the left-hand side.
- A map at the top of US States and being able to click on each state and have it show in the body of the page the parks in that state.
- Double heart as a click feature on the park card to mark you'd like to go back to that park.
- Mapping as a click feature on the park card to mark you've visited that park.
